Objects and its internal representation:

Object is a non-primitive data type in Javascript. It's an entity having properties and methods.HTTP/1.1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded, it blocks all the other resources behind it.

Example of an object:

var mybike={};

mybike.make="Bajaj";
mybike.model="2015";
mybike.color="Black";
mybike.price=70000;

The another way of declaring an object is,

var mybike = {make:"Bajaj",model:"2015",color:"black",price:70000};

An object can include different data types as its value for the key. For example listed above, the values of the keys make,model and color are of string data type , where as the key price contains a number data type.
